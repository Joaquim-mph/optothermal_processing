"""
Metric extractors for deriving analytical results from measurements.

Each extractor implements the MetricExtractor interface and computes one
or more related metrics from staged measurement data.

Available extractors:
- CNPExtractor: Charge neutrality point from IVg/VVg
- CalibrationMatcher: Laser calibration association and power interpolation
